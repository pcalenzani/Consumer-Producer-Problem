# CSC415 - Consumer/Producer Problem

## Author: Piero Calenzani

  This is my implementation of synchronization and semaphores to resolve race conditions created by the Consumers/Producers
  
## Part 1

  Part 1 adds synchronization to an earlier iteration of chaotic pthreads trying to create as many race conditions as possible
  
## Part 2

  Part 2 is the solution to the Consumer/Producer problem using a buffer queue to cleanly sort and process information traveling betweeen consumers and producers
